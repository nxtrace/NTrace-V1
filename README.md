## How To Use

Document Language: English | [简体中文](README_zh_CN.md)

⚠️ Please note: We welcome PR submissions from the community, but please submit your PRs to the [NTrace-V1](https://github.com/nxtrace/NTrace-V1) repository instead of [NTrace-core](https://github.com/nxtrace/NTrace-core) repository.<br>
Regarding the NTrace-V1 and NTrace-core repositories:<br>
Both will largely remain consistent with each other. All development work is done within the NTrace-V1 repository. The NTrace-V1 repository releases new versions first. After running stably for an undetermined period, we will synchronize that version to NTrace-core. This means that the NTrace-V1 repository serves as a "beta" or "testing" version.<br>
Please note, there are exceptions to this synchronization. If a version of NTrace-V1 encounters a serious bug, NTrace-core will skip that flawed version and synchronize directly to the next version that resolves the issue.

### Manual Install
* Download the precompiled executable

    For users not covered by the above methods, please go directly to [Release](https://www.nxtrace.org/downloads) to download the compiled binary executable.

    * `Release` provides compiled binary executables for many systems and different architectures. If none are available, you can compile it yourself.
    * Some essential dependencies of this project are not fully implemented on `Windows` by `Golang`, so currently, `NextTrace` is in an experimental support phase on the `Windows` platform.

### Get Started

`NextTrace` uses the `ICMP` protocol to perform TraceRoute requests by default, which supports both `IPv4` and `IPv6`

```bash
# IPv4 ICMP Trace
nexttrace 1.0.0.1
# URL
nexttrace http://example.com:8080/index.html?q=1

# Form printing
nexttrace --table 1.0.0.1

# An Output Easy to Parse
nexttrace --raw 1.0.0.1
nexttrace --json 1.0.0.1

# IPv4/IPv6 Resolve Only, and automatically select the first IP when there are multiple IPs
nexttrace --ipv4 g.co
nexttrace --ipv6 g.co

# IPv6 ICMP Trace
nexttrace 2606:4700:4700::1111

# Developer mode: set the ENV variable NEXTTRACE_DEVMODE=1 to make fatal errors panic with a stack trace.
export NEXTTRACE_DEVMODE=1

# Disable Path Visualization With the -M parameter
nexttrace koreacentral.blob.core.windows.net
# MapTrace URL: https://api.nxtrace.org/tracemap/html/c14e439e-3250-5310-8965-42a1e3545266.html

# Disable MPLS display using the --disable-mpls / -e parameter or the NEXTTRACE_DISABLEMPLS environment variable
nexttrace --disable-mpls example.com
export NEXTTRACE_DISABLEMPLS=1
```

PS: The route visualization module is an independent component, You can find its source code at [nxtrace/traceMap](https://github.com/nxtrace/traceMap).  
The routing visualization function requires the geographical coordinates of each Hop, but third-party APIs generally do not provide this information, so this function is currently only supported when used with LeoMoeAPI.

#### Mandatory Configuration Steps for `Windows` Users

- **For Normal User Mode:**  
  Only **ICMP mode** can be used, and the firewall must allow `ICMP/ICMPv6` traffic.
    ```powershell
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="All ICMP v4" dir=in action=allow protocol=icmpv4:any,any
    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="All ICMP v6" dir=in action=allow protocol=icmpv6:any,any
    ```  
- **For Administrator Mode:**  
  **TCP/UDP mode** requires additional installation of `npcap` and `WinDivert`.  
  **ICMP mode** requires allowing `ICMP/ICMPv6` in the firewall if `npcap` and `WinDivert` are not installed.  
  You can download and install `npcap` from the official website ([https://npcap.com/#download](https://npcap.com/#download)), and `WinDivert` can be automatically configured using the `--init` parameter.

#### `NextTrace` now supports quick testing, and friends who have a one-time backhaul routing test requirement can use it

```bash
# IPv4 ICMP Fast Test (Beijing + Shanghai + Guangzhou + Hangzhou) in China Telecom / Unicom / Mobile / Education Network
nexttrace --fast-trace

# You can also use TCP SYN for testing
nexttrace --fast-trace --tcp

# You can also quickly test through a customized IP/DOMAIN list file
nexttrace --file /path/to/your/iplist.txt
# CUSTOMIZED IP DOMAIN LIST FILE FORMAT
## One IP/DOMAIN per line + space + description information (optional)
## forExample:
## 106.37.67.1 BEIJING-TELECOM
## 240e:928:101:31a::1 BEIJING-TELECOM
## bj.10086.cn BEIJING-MOBILE
## 2409:8080:0:1::1
## 223.5.5.5
```

#### `NextTrace` already supports route tracing for specified Network Devices

```bash
# Use eth0 network interface
nexttrace --dev eth0 2606:4700:4700::1111

# Use eth0 network interface's IP
# When using the network interface's IP for route tracing, note that the IP type to be traced should be the same as network interface's IP type (e.g. both IPv4)
nexttrace --source 204.98.134.56 9.9.9.9
```

#### `NextTrace` can also use `TCP` and `UDP` protocols to perform `Traceroute` requests

```bash
# TCP SYN Trace
nexttrace --tcp www.bing.com

# You can specify the port by yourself [here is 443], the default port is 80
nexttrace --tcp --port 443 2001:4860:4860::8888

# UDP Trace
nexttrace --udp 1.0.0.1

# You can specify the target port yourself [here it is 5353], the default is port 33494
nexttrace --udp --port 5353 1.0.0.1

# For TCP/UDP Trace, you can specify the source port; by default, a fixed random port is used 
# (If you need to use a different random source port for each packet, please set the ENV variable NEXTTRACE_RANDOMPORT, or set the source port to -1)
nexttrace --tcp --source-port 14514 www.bing.com
```

#### `NextTrace` also supports some advanced functions, such as ttl control, concurrent probe packet count control, mode switching, etc.

```bash
# Send 2 probe packets per hop
nexttrace --queries 2 www.hkix.net

# Set the maximum attempts per TTL
nexttrace --max-attempts 10 www.hkix.net
# or use the ENV variable NEXTTRACE_MAXATTEMPTS to persist across runs
export NEXTTRACE_MAXATTEMPTS=10

# No concurrent probe packets, only one probe packet is sent at a time
nexttrace --parallel-requests 1 www.hkix.net

# Start Trace with TTL of 5, end at TTL of 10
nexttrace --first 5 --max-hops 10 www.decix.net
# In addition, an ENV is provided to set whether to mask the destination IP and omit its hostname
export NEXTTRACE_ENABLEHIDDENDSTIP=1

# Turn off the IP reverse parsing function
nexttrace --no-rdns www.bbix.net

# Set the payload size to 1024 bytes
nexttrace --psize 1024 example.com

# Feature: print Route-Path diagram
# Route-Path diagram example:
# AS6453 Tata Communication「Singapore『Singapore』」
#  ╭╯
#  ╰AS9299 Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.「Philippines『Metro Manila』」
#  ╭╯
#  ╰AS36776 Five9 Inc.「Philippines『Metro Manila』」
#  ╭╯
#  ╰AS37963 Aliyun「ALIDNS.COM『ALIDNS.COM』」
nexttrace --route-path www.time.com.my

# Disable color output
nexttrace --no-color 1.1.1.1
# or use ENV
export NO_COLOR=1
```

#### `NextTrace` supports users to select their own IP API (currently supports: `LeoMoeAPI`, `IP.SB`, `IPInfo`, `IPInsight`, `IPAPI.com`, `Ip2region`, `IPInfoLocal`, `CHUNZHEN`)

```bash
# You can specify the IP database by yourself [IP-API.com here], if not specified, LeoMoeAPI will be used
nexttrace --data-provider ip-api.com
## Note There are frequency limits for free queries of the ipinfo and IPInsight APIs. You can purchase services from these providers to remove the limits
##      If necessary, you can clone this project, add the token provided by ipinfo or IPInsight and compile it yourself
##      Fill the token to: ipgeo/tokens.go

## Note For the offline database IPInfoLocal, please download it manually and rename it to ipinfoLocal.mmdb. (You can download it from here: https://ipinfo.io/signup?ref=free-database-downloads)
##      Current directory, nexttrace binary directory and FHS directories (Unix-like) will be searched.
##      To customize it, please use environment variables,
export NEXTTRACE_IPINFOLOCALPATH=/xxx/yyy.mmdb
##      For the offline database Ip2region, you can download it manually and rename it to ip2region.db, or let NextTrace download it automatically
## Please be aware: Due to the serious abuse of IP.SB, you will often be not able to query IP data from this source
## IP-API.com has a stricter restiction on API calls, if you can't query IP data from this source, please try again in a few minutes

# The Pure-FTPd IP database defaults to using http://127.0.0.1:2060 as the query interface. To customize it, please use environment variables
export NEXTTRACE_CHUNZHENURL=http://127.0.0.1:2060
## You can use https://github.com/freshcn/qqwry to build your own Pure-FTPd IP database service

# You can also specify the default IP database by setting an environment variable
export NEXTTRACE_DATAPROVIDER=ipinfo
```

#### `NextTrace` supports mixed parameters and shortened parameters

```bash
Example:
nexttrace --data-provider IPAPI.com --max-hops 20 --tcp --port 443 --queries 5 --no-rdns 1.1.1.1
nexttrace -tcp --queries 2 --parallel-requests 1 --table --route-path 2001:4860:4860::8888

Equivalent to:
nexttrace -d ip-api.com -m 20 -T -p 443 -q 5 -n 1.1.1.1
nexttrace -T -q 2 --parallel-requests 1 -t -P 2001:4860:4860::8888
```

### Globalping

[Globalping](https://globalping.io/) provides access to thousands of community hosted probes to run network tests and measurements.

Run traceroute from a specified location by using the `--from` flag. The location field accepts continents, countries, regions, cities, ASNs, ISPs, or cloud regions.

```bash
nexttrace google.com --from Germany
nexttrace google.com --from comcast+california
```

A limit of 250 tests per hour is set for all anonymous users. To double the limit to 500 per hour please set the `GLOBALPING_TOKEN` environment variable with your token.

```bash
export GLOBALPING_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### IP Database

We use [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools) as a data provider for routing tables.

NextTrace BackEnd is now open-source.

https://github.com/sjlleo/nexttrace-backend

NextTrace `LeoMoeAPI` now utilizes the Proof of Work (POW) mechanism to prevent abuse, where NextTrace introduces the powclient library as a client-side component. Both the POW CLIENT and SERVER are open source, and everyone is welcome to use them. (Please direct any POW module-related questions to the corresponding repositories)

- [GitHub - tsosunchia/powclient: Proof of Work CLIENT for NextTrace](https://github.com/tsosunchia/powclient)
- [GitHub - tsosunchia/powserver: Proof of Work SERVER for NextTrace](https://github.com/tsosunchia/powserver)

## LeoMoeAPI Credits

NextTrace focuses on Golang Traceroute implementations, and its LeoMoeAPI geolocation information is not supported by raw data, so a commercial version is not possible.

The LeoMoeAPI data is subject to copyright restrictions from multiple data sources, and is only used for the purpose of displaying the geolocation of route tracing.

1. We would like to credit samleong123 for providing nodes in Malaysia, TOHUNET Looking Glass for global nodes, and Ping.sx from Misaka, where more than 80% of reliable calibration data comes from ping/mtr reports.

2. At the same time, we would like to credit isyekong for their contribution to rDNS-based calibration ideas and data. LeoMoeAPI is accelerating the development of rDNS resolution function, and has already achieved automated geolocation resolution for some backbone networks, but there are some misjudgments. We hope that NextTrace will become a One-Man ISP-friendly traceroute tool in the future, and we are working on improving the calibration of these ASN micro-backbones as much as possible.

3. In terms of development, I would like to credit missuo and zhshch for their help with Go cross-compilation, design concepts and TCP/UDP Traceroute refactoring, and tsosunchia for their support on TraceMap.

4. I would also like to credit FFEE_CO, TheresaQWQ, stydxm and others for their help. LeoMoeAPI has received a lot of support since its first release, so I would like to credit them all!

We hope you can give us as much feedback as possible on IP geolocation errors (see issue) so that it can be calibrated in the first place and others can benefit from it.
